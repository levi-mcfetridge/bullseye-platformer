# Bullseye-Platformer

An arcade-style platformer built in **Godot (GDScript)**.

Created in a 24-hour game jam. Second-place finish!

Design Theme was **Cyberpunk**
Gameplay Theme **You only get one BLANK**

My team decided to make a game following the theme: **You only get one bullet in the chamber**.
