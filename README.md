# Bullseye-Platformer

An arcade-style platformer built in **Godot** (Logic written in GDScript, a similar language to Python).

Created in a 24-hour game jam. Second-place finish!

Design Theme was **Cyberpunk**
Gameplay Theme **You only get one BLANK**

My team decided to make a game following the theme: **You only get one bullet in the chamber**.

- Responsive platforming (coyote time, wallsliding, snappy air control).
- Custom player physics for the best player experience.
